                At this very moment, this is my wife and I's spirit animal. She insisted that I use this photo for my
                first blog post, and I figured she was thinking in the right direction. Anyway, let's get down to
                business.

                <h3 class="blogging-heading">InJapan: What is it about?</h3>
                <p class="blogging-paragraph">
                    Well, to say it simply, this blog is about supplying people around the world knowledge about Japan.
                    This
                    isn't the only blog about Japan, but the one thing this blog will be able to do is tell the truth,
                    and
                    only the truth. Before I came to Japan, I thought I had learned all about its culture through its
                    sources of media...in other words, manga, anime, video games, movies and basic news sources such as
                    NHK.
                    But the truth is, those sources only displayed how great Japan was, and not the issues that are
                    prevalent here. Most people who have never been to Japan or have visited for a short period of time,
                    see
                    Japan as this super peaceful and nice country. I won't deny that the people of Japan are nice, but I
                    feel the passive-aggressive mindset of Asia in general goes unnoticed by foreigners. This isn't me
                    trying to bash Japan or anything, but this is an attempt to shine the light on real life experiences
                    as
                    a foreigner who lives and sees Japan on a daily basis. With that said, my focus is to provide real,
                    raw-uncut information about Japan's culture and society. At the same time, I will like to provide
                    bite-size information on the Japanese language and other random topics pertaining to my experiences
                    here
                    in Japan.

                <h3 class="blogging-heading">The Blogger: Who am I?</h3>
                <p class="blogging-paragraph">
                    You can call me the WizardToad for now! I am married to a Taiwanese Woman (Also known as the Toad
                    Sorceress) that works here in Japan, and keeps me in check on a daily basis. I am an American/German
                    that aspires to work in game development one day. At this very time, I am a senior in
                    College pursuing a Bachelor in Computer Science. I have many hobbies which include super nerdy ones
                    such
                    as reading manga, watching anime, and playing World of Warcraft. I have some non-nerdy
                    hobbies too like any sport activity. I am currently studying Japanese, and have recently taken the
                    JPLT
                    N3 last December 2019...I'm not very confident that I passed, but we will see the results this
                    coming
                    Februray 2021! Mentioning Japanese, in the future, when my Japanese abilities allow, I will have all
                    my
                    blog posts written in both English and Japanese. For now, majority of them will be in English, but I
                    will provide short posts in Japanese. Anyway, that is enough about me for now...let's talk about
                    future
                    goals!

                <h3 class="blogging-heading">InJapan: Future Expectations?</h3>
                <p class="blogging-paragraph">
                    Honestly, I am not sure about the future expectations of this blog website. I hope to be able to
                    maintain it and be able to connect with others that are interested in learning through my
                    experiences.
                    I expect to continue on building from this beginning, and establishing a site where many others can
                    gather and learn about Japan as if they were living in the country themselves. Maybe as time goes
                    on, I
                    can reveal my true identity, but until then...I am WizardToad!
